  abstract  = {The current generation of sensor nodes rely on commodity components. The choice of the radio is particularly important as it impacts not only energy consumption but also software design (e.g., network self-assembly, multihop routing and in-network processing). Bluetooth is one of the most popular commodity radios for wireless devices. As a representative of the frequency hopping spread spectrum radios, it is a natural alternative to broadcast radios in the context of sensor networks. The question is whether Bluetooth can be a viable alternative in practice. In this paper, we report our experience using Bluetooth for the sensor network regime. We describe our tiny Bluetooth stack that allows TinyOS applications to run on Bluetooth-based sensor nodes, we present a multihop network assembly procedure that leverages Bluetooth's device discovery protocol, and we discuss how Bluetooth favorably impacts in-network query processing. Our results show that despite obvious limitations the Bluetooth sensor nodes we studied exhibit interesting properties, such as a good energy per bit sent ratio. This reality check underlies the limitations and some promises of Bluetooth for the sensor network regime.},

  abstract = {Since its introduction in 2009, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has become a remarkable success. Due to its unique properties of low power requirements and its ubiquitous availability in practically every smartphone, it outnumbered classic Bluetooth BR/EDR in most areas. It enabled a multitude of new product categories like smart watches or connected health care devices that would not be feasible without such a technology. We are currently facing version 5.2 of the specification which is the result of a number of major and minor revisions, each fixing problems of earlier versions while adding new features and capabilities. This includes more secure pairing methods, like secure connection pairing. Cyber security was considered from the beginning of the Bluetooth specification and has been improved with each specification release. On the other hand, security weaknesses in the specification as well as in individual Bluetooth stack implementations have been identified. Designing a secure BLE device, or analyzing its security is a complicated task due to the overwhelming number of possible configurations. As the specification introduces constantly new features and subtle changes regarding privacy and security, this will become an even more complex task. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic overview over the current state of BLE does exist that covers the security and privacy properties of the different BLE versions and features including known weaknesses and attacks in a single place. With this survey we want to fill this gap.}

  abstract   = {Ubiquitous connectivity among objects is the future of the coming Internet of Things era. Technologies are competing fiercely to fulfill this goal, but none of them can fit into all application scenarios. However, efforts are still made to expand application ranges of certain technologies. Shortly after the adoption of its newest version, Bluetooth 5.0, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group released another new specification on network topology: Bluetooth Mesh. Combined together, those two bring Bluetooth to a brand new stage. However, current works related to it only focus on part of the new Bluetooth, and discussion over the entire one is lacking. Therefore, in this survey, we conduct an investigation toward the new Bluetooth from a comprehensive perspective. Through this, we show that the new Bluetooth not only consolidates its strengths in original application fields but also brings alterations and opportunities to new ones, making it a strong competitor in the future for providing complete solutions to meet the demands of seamless communications in the Internet of Things area.},

  abstract  = {Hundred millions of Internet of Things devices implement ZigBee, a low-power mesh network standard, and the number is expected to be growing. To facilitate an easy integration of new devices into a ZigBee network, touchlink commissioning was developed. It was adopted in the latest specifications, ZigBee 3.0, which were released to the public in December 2016, as one of two commissioning options for ZigBee devices. ZigBee 3.0 products can be used in various applications, also including security-critical products such as door locks and intruder alarm systems. The aim of this work is to warn about a further adoption of this commissioning mode. We analyze the security of touchlink commissioning procedure and present novel attacks that make direct use of standard's features, showing that this commissioning procedure is insecure by design. We release an open-source penetration testing framework to evaluate the practical implications of these vulnerabilities. Evaluating our tools on popular ZigBee-certified products, we demonstrate that a passive eavesdropper can extract key material from a distance of 130 meters. Furthermore, an active attacker is able to take-over devices from distances of 190 meters. Our analysis concludes that even a single touchlink-enabled device is sufficient to compromise the security of a ZigBee 3.0 network, and therefore, touchlink commissioning should not be supported in any future ZigBee products.},
