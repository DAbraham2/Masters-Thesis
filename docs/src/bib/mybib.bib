  abstract  = {The current generation of sensor nodes rely on commodity components. The choice of the radio is particularly important as it impacts not only energy consumption but also software design (e.g., network self-assembly, multihop routing and in-network processing). Bluetooth is one of the most popular commodity radios for wireless devices. As a representative of the frequency hopping spread spectrum radios, it is a natural alternative to broadcast radios in the context of sensor networks. The question is whether Bluetooth can be a viable alternative in practice. In this paper, we report our experience using Bluetooth for the sensor network regime. We describe our tiny Bluetooth stack that allows TinyOS applications to run on Bluetooth-based sensor nodes, we present a multihop network assembly procedure that leverages Bluetooth's device discovery protocol, and we discuss how Bluetooth favorably impacts in-network query processing. Our results show that despite obvious limitations the Bluetooth sensor nodes we studied exhibit interesting properties, such as a good energy per bit sent ratio. This reality check underlies the limitations and some promises of Bluetooth for the sensor network regime.},

  abstract = {Since its introduction in 2009, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has become a remarkable success. Due to its unique properties of low power requirements and its ubiquitous availability in practically every smartphone, it outnumbered classic Bluetooth BR/EDR in most areas. It enabled a multitude of new product categories like smart watches or connected health care devices that would not be feasible without such a technology. We are currently facing version 5.2 of the specification which is the result of a number of major and minor revisions, each fixing problems of earlier versions while adding new features and capabilities. This includes more secure pairing methods, like secure connection pairing. Cyber security was considered from the beginning of the Bluetooth specification and has been improved with each specification release. On the other hand, security weaknesses in the specification as well as in individual Bluetooth stack implementations have been identified. Designing a secure BLE device, or analyzing its security is a complicated task due to the overwhelming number of possible configurations. As the specification introduces constantly new features and subtle changes regarding privacy and security, this will become an even more complex task. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic overview over the current state of BLE does exist that covers the security and privacy properties of the different BLE versions and features including known weaknesses and attacks in a single place. With this survey we want to fill this gap.}

  abstract   = {Ubiquitous connectivity among objects is the future of the coming Internet of Things era. Technologies are competing fiercely to fulfill this goal, but none of them can fit into all application scenarios. However, efforts are still made to expand application ranges of certain technologies. Shortly after the adoption of its newest version, Bluetooth 5.0, the Bluetooth Special Interest Group released another new specification on network topology: Bluetooth Mesh. Combined together, those two bring Bluetooth to a brand new stage. However, current works related to it only focus on part of the new Bluetooth, and discussion over the entire one is lacking. Therefore, in this survey, we conduct an investigation toward the new Bluetooth from a comprehensive perspective. Through this, we show that the new Bluetooth not only consolidates its strengths in original application fields but also brings alterations and opportunities to new ones, making it a strong competitor in the future for providing complete solutions to meet the demands of seamless communications in the Internet of Things area.},

Preventing attacks and reducing vulnerabilities is imperative in cases where there can be high financial losses due to poor security implementations. For systems where low power and cost are desirable, but security is a priority, the application developer must be extremely cautious in the design of their network.

  abstract  = {IoT security is a topic that offers numerous opportunities for improvement and development. In this paper, we first present a set of open-source mock IoT applications along with the necessary infrastructure specifically designed to emulate a real IoT system. With our app set, users can add their own applications, automation rules, and communication flows with little technical effort, and test different scenarios to reproduce bugs that are not specific to the use of a single device. Second, we describe a functional testing framework for the IoT that is inspired by behavior-driven development (BDD), a testing methodology that serves as a proof-of-concept for how the application set can be used in different test scenarios. The application set and the functional testing framework are independent of each other. Our goal is to help IoT developers and testers find new testing techniques and benchmarking them in a reproducible, comparable, and less biased environment. We believe that they form the basis for a better understanding of how to test systems composed of heterogeneous devices to find issues and vulnerabilities that arise mainly from their interaction and data persistence management.},

  abstract  = {Testing heterogeneous IoT applications such as a home automation systems integrating a variety of devices poses serious challenges. Oftentimes requirements are vaguely defined. Consumer grade cyber-physical devices and software may not meet the reliability and quality standard needed. Plus, system behavior may partially depend on various environmental conditions. For example, WI-FI congestion may cause packet delay; meanwhile cold weather may cause an unexpected drop of inside temperature.We surmise that generating and executing failure exposing scenarios is especially challenging. Modeling phenomenons such as network traffic or weather conditions is complex. One possible solution is to rely on machine learning models approximating the reality. These models, integrated in a system model, can be used to define surrogate models and fitness functions to steer the search in the direction of failure inducing scenarios.However, these models also should be validated. Therefore, there should be a double loop co-evolution between machine learned surrogate models functions and fitness functions.Overall, we argue that in such complex cyber-physical systems, co-evolution and multi-hybrid approaches are needed.},

Consequently, it can impact many aspects of everyday life, and errors can have serious consequences. Despite this, there is a lack of standard testing processes and methods, which poses a major challenge for IoT testing. Nonetheless, closer examination makes it possible to identify a set of recurring behaviors of IoT applications and a set of corresponding test strategies. This paper formalizes the notion of a Pattern-Based IoT Testing method for systematizing and automating the testing of IoT ecosystems.

Such applications are typically integrated with various third-party healthcare applications and medical devices through REST APIs. This integrated network of healthcare IoT applications leads to REST APIs with complicated and interdependent structures, thus creating a major challenge for automated system-level testing. We report an industrial evaluation of a state-of-the-art REST APIs testing approach (RESTest) on a real-world healthcare IoT application. We analyze the effectiveness of RESTest’s testing strategies regarding REST APIs failures, faults in the application, and REST API coverage, by experimenting with six REST APIs of 41 API endpoints of the healthcare IoT application. Results show that several failures are discovered in different REST APIs with ≈56\% coverage using RESTest. Moreover, nine potential faults are identified. Using the evidence collected from the experiments, we provide our experiences and lessons learned.},

  abstract  = {Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly present in people’s daily lives. Thus has increased research interest in investigating strategies that can ensure that these applications work as expected considering specific and vital characteristics of IoT, for example, security, performance and interoperability. In a testing point of view, there is a need to optimize and define an efficient strategy, from its planning to its execution. Considering all the steps that can be taken to test an IoT application, this process, if performed manually, can demand great effort and time. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied in several areas of computing in order to optimize and automate processes that involve large volumes of data. In this paper, we present a systematic mapping resulting in 40 studies that highlights techniques or approaches that use machine learning algorithms for the most diverse goals within the IoT application testing process, such as the use of neural networks for predicting the cost of time in the preparation and execution of tests; identification of security attacks; and automatic generation of test cases from textual language. We also identified that the vast majority of testing techniques are focused on a specific IoT characteristic (e.g., security, performance), specially security, and apply the machine learning algorithm in two ways: directly in the algorithm, called predictive maintenance, or during the execution of planned tests, both of them bring difficulties related to extracting and defining data to train ML algorithms.},

This paper argues that this belief need no longer be justified by presenting the architecture and basic properties of 1KT, our new smart-building IoT testbed for solutions utilizing IEEE 802.15.4 and Bluetooth Low Energy. It comprises 1000 experimental devices deployed directly in human spaces of 168 rooms on all 5 floors of a sizable building. At the same time, its cost is relatively low considering the scale.},

Due to the broad spectrum of applications, networks facilitating IoT scenarios can be of very different scale and complexity. Additionally, connected devices are uncommonly heterogeneous, including micro controllers, smartphones, fog nodes and server infrastructures. Therefore, testing IoT applications is difficult, motivating adequate tool support.In this paper, we present H\'{e}ctor, a framework for the automatic testing of IoT applications. H\'{e}ctor allows the automated execution of user-defined experiments on agnostic IoT testbeds. To test applications independently of the availability of required devices, the framework is able to generate virtual testbeds with adjustable network properties. Our evaluations show that simple experiments can be easily automated across a broad spectrum of testbeds. However, the results also indicate that there is considerable interference in experiments, in which many devices are emulated, due to the high resource demand of system emulation.},

  abstract  = {Bluetooth is a pervasive technology for wireless communication. Billions of devices use it in sensitive applications and to exchange private data. The security of Bluetooth depends on the Bluetooth standard and its two security mechanisms: pairing and session establishment. No prior work, including the standard itself, analyzed the future and forward secrecy guarantees of these mechanisms, e.g., if Bluetooth pairing and session establishment defend past and future sessions when the adversary compromises the current. To address this gap, we present six novel attacks, defined as the BLUFFS attacks, breaking Bluetooth sessions' forward and future secrecy. Our attacks enable device impersonation and machine-in-the-middle across sessions by only compromising one session key. The attacks exploit two novel vulnerabilities that we uncover in the Bluetooth standard related to unilateral and repeatable session key derivation. As the attacks affect Bluetooth at the architectural level, they are effective regardless of the victim's hardware and software details (e.g., chip, stack, version, and security mode).We also release BLUFFS, a low-cost toolkit to perform and automatically check the effectiveness of our attacks. The toolkit employs seven original patches to manipulate and monitor Bluetooth session key derivation by dynamically patching a closed-source Bluetooth firmware that we reverse-engineered. We show that our attacks have a critical and large-scale impact on the Bluetooth ecosystem, by evaluating them on seventeen diverse Bluetooth chips (eighteen devices) from popular hardware and software vendors and supporting the most popular Bluetooth versions. Motivated by our empirical findings, we develop and successfully test an enhanced key derivation function for Bluetooth that stops by-design our six attacks and their four root causes. We show how to effectively integrate our fix into the Bluetooth standard and discuss alternative implementation-level mitigations. We responsibly disclosed our contributions to the Bluetooth SIG.},

We adapt techniques from wireless traffic analysis and intrusion-detection systems to develop behavioral models that capture typical, authentic device interactions (behavior); these models enable recurring verification of device behavior. To evaluate our approach we produced a new dataset consisting of more than 300 Bluetooth network traces collected from 20 Bluetooth-enabled smart-health and smart-home devices. In our evaluation, we found that devices can be correctly verified at a variety of granularities, achieving an F1-score of 0.86 or better in most cases.},

  abstract  = {With the proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Zigbee is widely adopted as a resource-efficient wireless protocol. Recently, severe vulnerabilities in Zigbee protocol implementations have compromised IoT devices from different manufacturers. It becomes imperative to perform security testing on Zigbee protocol implementations. However, it is not a trivial task to apply the existing vulnerability detection techniques such as fuzzing to Zigbee protocol implementations. In particular, it remains a significant obstacle to deal with low-level hardware events. Many existing protocol fuzzing tools lack a proper execution environment for the Zigbee protocol, which communicates via a radio channel instead of the Internet.To bridge the above gap, we develop a device-agnostic fuzzing platform named Z-Fuzzer to detect security vulnerabilities in Zigbee protocol implementations. Z-Fuzzer provides a software simulation environment with pre-defined peripherals and hardware interrupts configurations to simulate Zigbee protocol execution on real IoT devices. We first extend the existing protocol fuzzing framework's capabilities with a proxy server to bridge communication with the Zigbee protocol execution. Second, we generate more high-quality test cases with code-coverage heuristics. We compare Z-Fuzzer with advanced protocol fuzzing tools, BooFuzz and Peach fuzzer, on top of Z-Fuzzer's simulation platform. Our results show that Z-Fuzzer can achieve higher code coverage in a mainstream Zigbee protocol implementation called Z-Stack. Z-Fuzzer has detected more vulnerabilities using fewer test cases than BooFuzz and Peach. Three of them have been assigned CVE IDs with high CVSS scores (7.5~8.2).},

However, in this paper, we find Zigbee-related attacks in which adversaries are outside of the target network and have no knowledge of the encryption keys. The low attack requirements pose high threats. The attacks mislead devices to accept forged packets, which will jeopardize the normal operations of Zigbee networks. We further develop a framework to efficiently identify such problems. The framework supports flexible modification of address and network information, and bit-level manipulations from the MAC layer. To accelerate analysis, we design semantic-aware fuzzing to generate packet candidates that are more likely to produce meaningful results.  We conduct experiments on 10 real-world Zigbee systems. Using our approach, we have identified five types of practical attacks, ranging from communication disruption to security key leakage. We show proof-of-concept attacks on industry Zigbee products and systems. Our findings bring to light new security issues of Zigbee and further motivate possible mitigation approaches.},

  abstract  = {Hundred millions of Internet of Things devices implement ZigBee, a low-power mesh network standard, and the number is expected to be growing. To facilitate an easy integration of new devices into a ZigBee network, touchlink commissioning was developed. It was adopted in the latest specifications, ZigBee 3.0, which were released to the public in December 2016, as one of two commissioning options for ZigBee devices. ZigBee 3.0 products can be used in various applications, also including security-critical products such as door locks and intruder alarm systems. The aim of this work is to warn about a further adoption of this commissioning mode. We analyze the security of touchlink commissioning procedure and present novel attacks that make direct use of standard's features, showing that this commissioning procedure is insecure by design. We release an open-source penetration testing framework to evaluate the practical implications of these vulnerabilities. Evaluating our tools on popular ZigBee-certified products, we demonstrate that a passive eavesdropper can extract key material from a distance of 130 meters. Furthermore, an active attacker is able to take-over devices from distances of 190 meters. Our analysis concludes that even a single touchlink-enabled device is sufficient to compromise the security of a ZigBee 3.0 network, and therefore, touchlink commissioning should not be supported in any future ZigBee products.},

  abstract  = {Over the last decade, fuzzing has been increasingly gaining  
               traction due to its effectiveness in finding  
               bugs. Nevertheless, fuzzer evaluations have been challenging  
               during this time, mainly due to lack of standardized  
               benchmarking. Aiming to alleviate this issue, in 2020, Google  
               released FuzzBench, an open-source benchmarking platform, that  
               is widely used for accurate fuzzer benchmarking.  
               
               However, a typical FuzzBench experiment takes CPU years to  
               run. If we additionally consider that fuzzers under active  
               development evaluate any changes empirically, benchmarking  
               becomes prohibitive both in terms of computational resources  
               and time. In this paper, we propose GreenBench, a greener  
               benchmarking platform that, compared to FuzzBench,  
               significantly speeds up fuzzer evaluations while maintaining  
               very high accuracy.  
               
               In contrast to FuzzBench, GreenBench drastically increases the  
               number of benchmarks while drastically decreasing the duration  
               of fuzzing campaigns. As a result, the fuzzer rankings  
               generated by GreenBench are almost as accurate as those by  
               FuzzBench (with very high correlation), but GreenBench is from  
               18 to 61 times faster. We discuss the implications of these  
               findings for the fuzzing community.},

  abstract  = {The Thread networking protocol is expected to be utilized by a plethora of smart home devices as one of the IP-based networking technologies that will be supported by the Matter standard that is being developed by members of the Connectivity Standards Alliance. Thread has been developed by the Thread Group as an application-agnostic protocol that builds on top of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard to enable IPv6-based low-power wireless mesh networking. However, unlike other IEEE 802.15.4-based protocols like Zigbee, the security of Thread networks has been relatively less analyzed in the literature. Given that commercial Thread devices are expected to interact with the physical world, vulnerabilities in their communication protocols could impact the physical security of end users. In this work we analyze the security of Thread networks by repurposing hardware and software tools that have been used for the security analysis of Zigbee networks. We used development boards that were flashed with OpenThread binaries to gain insight into the nature of Thread traffic and to study their susceptibility to a set of energy depletion attacks and online password guessing attacks. Lastly, we are publicly releasing our software enhancements as well as our dataset of captured Thread packets.},

  abstract  = {Software testing is a fundamental activity of the broader software engineering process. Internet of Things (IoT) testing activities present unique characteristics that make their execution different from conventional software testing, including specific challenges, tools, approaches, and processes. Although the literature contains several secondary studies that summarize the contributions on this topic, there still needs to be more organization of these studies along a software development process. This paper reports preliminary literature results showing how the knowledge about software testing has been applied to developing and using IoT systems. We conducted an initial search on known papers’ databases in computing and supplemented this search by snowballing two literature reviews found in this previous search. This study’s main results show that most approaches and tools for software testing on IoT systems are grouped in the stages of Validation by Emulation or Simulation with approximately 43\% of the total of papers, followed by Validation by Testbed with approximately 24\%. Hence, there is an opportunity for exploring further the Development and Operation/Support stages. Our results will help researchers and practitioners know when and in what sequence to use techniques, processes, and test tools reported in the literature.},
